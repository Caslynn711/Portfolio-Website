<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a mom of 3 who loves tech. I'm currently learing web devolopment and project management. 
  My favorite languages that I've worked with are python and java. I went to school and got my computer programming certificate, but realized I still needed more learning.
  I had already changed my major several times and realized making another change to computer science just wasn't feasible. That's when I decided to go the self taught route. 
  I am currently looking for a internship, mentor, and/or tutor. Anyone or opportunity that will help me grow in my expertise and journey is very much welcomed.</p>

<p>Some of my favoite things to do are travleing, going to the movies, coding and spending time with my children. I'm also on a very much needed weightloss journey so I guess you can
   add gym rat to the list. I currently live in Florida, but am looking to move to Washington state. Originally from New York City, I miss the seasons, specifically fall. While I do
   have love for Florida, the pay here isn't so great, the hurricaines have gotten out of control over the years so it's time to say goodbye. I'm in need of a change in my life's journey.

  This is a challenge that I welcome due to the nature of how problem solving heaving coding is. Puzzles and finding solutions to tough problems has always been
  an area where I shine; enjoying the mental stimulation and exercise solving complex problems bring. There's nothing like being stuck on a particular code for days and finally 
  figuring out the solution in a dream....IYKYK. LOL! I'm very excited to showcase my work and my progress here. Please feel free to take a look around and contact me with any
  opportunities to learn more and/or work.
